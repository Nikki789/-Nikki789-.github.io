<h1>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h1>

<section>
<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
While modern technology certainly provides numerous advantages across multiple sectors, it
also has its share of disadvantages. The interconnectivity that links all devices and systems
to the web is a constant temptation to malicious forces, exposing users and businesses to an
extensive range of threats. With the sharing of devices, information and networks, these
risks have become complex.
</section>

<section>
<h2><a name="Main body">Main body</a></h2>
There are a number of sources describing the possible risks on the web ( Krishnamurthy,
Naryshkin, Wills, 2011, p.1; Krishnamurthy, Wills, 2009, p.7; Krishnamurthy, Naryshkin,
Wills, 2011, p.1, 3) . According to some, a major threat to personal information exposure are
the end users ( Abraham, Chengalur-Smith, 2010, p.183 ). Additional information from studies
supports that statement by showing that a great amount of web users would give personal
information referring to their demographic data to web sites, only if the sites provide an
explanation regarding how the information collected would be used ( Hoffman, Novak,
Peralta, 1999, p.82). However, these sources do not adequately take into account the fact
that many users are unaware that their information can be used for a variety of malicious
purposes ( Malandrino, Scarano, 2013, p.2834) . Furthermore, results from other sources
indicate that once the threats have been explained, the users appear to be willing to do
something to mitigate the threats (Consolvo, Jung, Greenstein, Powledge, Maganis,
Avrahami, 2010, p.321).
</section>

<section>
Pursuant to Gross and Acquisti’s article, while privacy may be at risk in social networking
sites, information is often willingly provided (2005, p.73). Many studies show that any type of
online collaboration and communication could undermine the privacy of the individuals,
especially when they visit popular Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter (Malandrino,
Scarano, 2013, p.2834). Mao, Shuai and Kapadia have found out that a lot of sensitive
information is revealed by Twitter users, not only about themselves but about other users
(2011, p.1). As a result, they become more vulnerable to hacker attacks. Malandrino and
Scarano’s paper provides empirical data study in order to describe how users’ privacy can
be undermined (Malandrino, Scarano, 2013, p.2834). The reported information from the
study shows that more than half of the analyzed sites directly leak sensitive and identifiable
information to third party aggregators.
</section>

<section>
An important topic,which also affects the user’s security is the knowledge of the attacker
(Gregg, Kim, 2006, p.107). Gregg and Kim’s work states that attackers usually look for
security defects, security limits or software vulnerabilities (2006, p.120). Schneier’s book
gives an example of a software vulnerability, such as the statefulness of the firewalls, which
makes it easier for malicious packets to pass through (2004, p.191). In addition, Abraham
and Chengalur-Smith’s article shows a definite upward trend of social engineering malware,
which indicates that users ought to be more cautious in order to remain protected from
threats such as phishing or tailgating (Abraham, Chengalur-Smith, 2010, Technology in
Society, p.284). Tiwana’s work advices the user to use software that encrypts username,
passwords and IP address combinations or to review the security policy and change them
when necessary (1999, p.326). Schneier’s book also admits that the use of encryption is
beneficial to the individual and suggests to the user to use randomly generated keys for the
encryption (2004, p.106).
</section>

<section>
Based on the information from Abraham and Chengalur-Smith’s article, identifying and
classifying threats is vital to building defensive mechanisms for the user (2010, p.183).
Consolvo, Jung, Greenstein, Powledge, Maganis and Avrahami’s article points out the
increased risk of personal information leakage from Wi-Fi by underlining that public Wi-Fi is
typically completely open or applies basic security schemes that provide little to no
protection for the user ( 2010, p.321 ). Nevertheless, in order to use many web services, a
user must provide personal data such as an email address and password, which are often
transmitted without encryption, in this way making it increasingly easy to track and aggregate
user information over time ( Consolvo, Jung, Greenstein, Powledge, Maganis and Avrahami ,
2010, p.321 ). Another example of data leakage is the way sites store private information
about the user, such as username, email address or password (Krishnamurthy, Naryshkin,
Wills, 2011, p.3). Consolvo, Jung, Greenstein, Powledge, Maganis and Avrahami’s work
highlights that anyone with a computing device who is within range of a virtual private
network can read and interpret all web traffic on the network (2010, p.321). Similarly,
Schneier agrees with that statement and claims that a lot of hacker attacks exploit holes in
the virtual private network, since it is allowed to tunnel through the firewall into the network
(2004, p.194).
</section>

<section>
Krishnamurthy, Malandrino and Wills’s work offers a variety of techniques, which can be
applied at a user’s browser or at a proxy on behalf of an organization and be used to protect
privacy-related information (2007, p.53). Despite the fact that protection mechanisms can be
very helpful, by using them the individual must have a clear idea of what is being protected
and their impact. For example, the same work states that if the user decides to filter requests
with the identifying URL filter, needed content could be removed from the page (2007, p.53).
Known privacy protection techniques at the browser include filtering out HTTP headers and
refusing third-party cookies (Krishnamurthy, Wills, 2009, p.11). Other approaches to
reducing personal information leakage are disabling JavaScript execution, filtering ads,
blocking images and anonymizing cookie content (Krishnamurthy, Malandrino, Wills, 2007,
p.53).
</section>

<section>
In spite of the large amount of ways to prevent the risk of personal information exposure,
Tiwana’s book represents a different point of view by emphasizing on the fact that failure
prevention can never be perfect and users would benefit more from damage alleviation
(1999, p.26). A classic example of Web-based business, named Amazon, had to totally shut
down for almost a full day since little preparedness was done for a total shutdown (Tiwana,
1999, p.27). Data is the most important aspect of a modern day computer, since computer
hardware can fail or the data on it can be corrupted and destroyed (Backup (Computer
Backup), para. 1 ). In this way the data backup software can be of great advantage to the
individual.

<h2><a  name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
Concluding this literature review, limiting risk is a vital part of the computer security, as
technology is constantly developing and so does the attacker’s software, which will always
make computers vulnerable. Even as computer systems continue to become more secure
through better software development and testing, they are just as easily breached by
attackers. Therefore, one of the actions which could be taken against the personal
information leakage is raising the user’s awareness about the risks of open wifi networks.
Moreover, the individual could also apply privacy protection techniques at the browser and
make a copy of the data stored on the machine. By using a combination of both technical
solutions such as encryption techniques and social educational strategies the user's private
record will be significantly more secure and the exposure of personal information on the web
will be mitigated.
