        <h3>I found different ways to arrange groups of information </h3>
        <h3>I did some additional research on the topic: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Information design is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters efficient and effective understanding of it. </li>
          <li>The term has come to be used specifically for graphic design for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression.</li>
          <li>Information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action. </li>

        <h2><a id="Thirteenth_week">Thirteenth week - Addressing the Web</a></h2>
        <h3>I learned that:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Every computer on the internet has a unique(ish) IP address.Global internet hostnames are translated to IP addresses using DNS</li>
          <li>Hostnames can be local and global</li>
          <li>The scheme part of the URL indicates the format in which the request should be sent. Common supported ones are:
            <ul>
              <li>ftp://</li>
              <li>http://</li>
              <li>https://</li>
              <li>file://</li>
              <li>mailto:</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Old ones we no longer see:
            <ul>
              <li>aol:// </li>
              <li>gopher://</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>DNS (Domain Name Service) is a global record of domains to IP addresses.Until recently, domains were allocated under countries,but some names are less restricted.</li>

          <li>Computers run network services on ports.Port numbers under 1024 are reserved for specific purposes</li>

          <li>Usernames and passwords can also be provided as part of an URL</li>
          <li>Query strings can also be passed via a URL, allowing server-side scripts to interpret them as variables,like:</li>
          <li>HyperText Transfer Protocol is the underlying protocol for the World Wide Web
          </li>
          <li>When a URL is entered into the address bar of a user, you are sending a HTTP GET request to the server. </li>
          <li>The fragments are also a part of the URL.</li>
          <li>There are two types of URLs:
            <ul>
              <li>Absolute,which must contain the scheme (e.g. http://) </li>
              <li>Relative,which specifies a URL relative to the page.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On Windows systems, file names are not case sensitive,but on Linux systems, file names are.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="Fourteenth_week">Fourteenth week - Website Marking Scheme</a></h2>
        <h3>I found out what the criteria for evaluating my WebF1 peers are.
          I had to alter my website since i had br tags,so I removed them to match the criteria.

      <section>
        <h2><a id="Fifteenth_week">Fifteenth week - Standards</a></h2>
        <h3>I learned where I can find a website for validation and chose to include it in my website:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>http://validator.w3.org/</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>I did some additional research on the web standards:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. </li>
          <li>The advantages in adhering to these standards are many:
            <ul>
              <li>Web pages will display in a wide variety of browsers and computers, including new technology.</li>
              <li>W3C Standards promote the use of "Cascading Style Sheets" (CSS) or design code which is attached to the web page rather than embedded in the page.</li>
              <li>Design features such as colors and fonts can be easily changed by just modifying one style sheet instead of editing every individual page in a web site, reducing the costs to modify your site.</li>
              <li>Search Engines are able to access and index pages designed to web standards with greater efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>508 section/rule</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual's ability to
            obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that
            will help achieve these goals.</li>

      <section>
        <h2><a id="Seventeenth_week">Seventeenth week - Accessibility</a></h2>
        <h3>Using the form from week seventeen,I decided to remove the font-size in order to make the website more accessible and not to justify the text.
          The website navigation and the media are supposed to increase the accessibility for everyone as well.</h3>

        <h2><a id="Eighteenth_week">Eighteenth week - Website submission & Basic JS/Canvas</a></h2>
        <h3>I found out how to upload the website on my virtual machine for assessment.I also started learning Javascript.</h3>
<h3>I started by reasearching what JavaScript is:</h3>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as compared to other languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python. </li>
<li>It is a high-level, interpreted language that can easily be embedded with languages like HTML. </li>
<li>Initially, JavaScript was known as LiveScript, but later Netscape changed its name to JavaScript. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Some amazing features of JavaScript are as follows:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easily embedded with languages like HTML, CSS, and Java.</li>
<li>Also works as a client-side scripting language, which helps in creating dynamic web pages.</li>
<li>JavaScript is an open source and cross-platform language and therefore mostly used for creating network-centric applications. Nowadays it has become an inseparable part of the core technologies of the internet. </li>
<li>JavaScript is used in web technologies to make web pages interactive. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is widely used in web servers and databases. Hence its wide popularity among these kinds of websites.</li>
